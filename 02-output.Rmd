# Outputs {#output}

R Markdown can transform plain text and code into several different document formats. 
There are also multiple ways to **Knit** or `render` the output.

## Output options

### HTML

HTML is overall the most flexible. 
It supports the types of content we're interested in creating as graduate students---tables, graphs, and the like---and you can easily transform your HTML output to a PDF with `pagedown::chrome_print(file)` if you have Google Chrome.
The [academic poster template](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown) that I like to use follows this process.

### PDF

If you're familiar with LaTeX, you may be inclined to output directly to a PDF, since you can include inline LaTeX code in your documents (more on this in Chapter \@ref(format)). 
The [CV](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) and [manuscript](https://github.com/rosannav/thesis_in_rmarkdown/tree/master/example_thesis) templates that I use rely on the fine-grained typesetting capabilities of LaTeX. 
To create a PDF, you need to have LaTeX installed locally. 
You should also install the [`tinytex`](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) distribution through the R console.

### Word

You can also output to Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. 
I prefer not to use this option if I can help it, because you lose several important functions; for example, chunk options for aligning and setting the size of graphs and other images don't work, and `kable` tables don't appear correctly.

There are a few workarounds for these issues.
Regarding images and graphs, I create them in a separate R script and save them in whatever size and format I need (e.g., .png).
Then, I include them in my document using a code chunk.

Regarding tables, the best solution I've found is to create them in a separate R Markdown document that knits to HTML, then copy and paste them into the finished Word Document or PowerPoint.
Obviously, this is not ideal, but this method retains the exact formatting of the tables from the HTML file.
You can save tables as images as well, but the copy-paste solution works best for journals requiring editable tables.

## Rendering options

### Knit

You can specify a particular output type in the YAML header with `output: output_format`
Then, you can press the **Knit** button or CTRL/command + shift + K to create or "knit" the document. 

Be sure to pay attention to indentation and colon placement in your YAML header, especially as you start to specify options for particular output types. 
As a rule of thumb, if you have anything more than `output: output_format`, you need to indent every new line, and have a colon at the end of the previous line. 
See Section \@ref(usedef) for an example of this.

### `rmarkdown::render`

Instead of knitting, you can also render files in the console with `rmarkdown::render(file, output_format)`. 
This is essentially what **Knit** is doing. 
This approach allows you to create multiple output types quickly and easily. 
I usually customize my output very specifically for one output type by adding inline CSS or LaTeX code, so I really only use `render` when I'm making [parameterized reports](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html%23parameter_types%2F).

## Rendering process

When you **Knit** or `render` your document, there's a particular sequence of events that happens under the hood. 
Your R Markdown document is piped through to pandoc by the `knitr` package, which runs your code chunks and knits them together with the plain text you've included. 
Pandoc ultimately handles the conversion to a particular output format. Understanding this process can help you troubleshoot when you run into issues. 
You can find more on troubleshooting in Chapter \@ref(trouble).
