# Outputs {#output}

R Markdown can transform plain text and code into several different document formats. There are also multiple ways to **Knit** or `render` the output.

## Output options

### html_document

HTML is overall the most flexible. It supports the types of content we're interested in creating as graduate students---tables, graphs, and the like---and you can easily transform your HTML output to a PDF with `pagedown::chrome_print(file)` if you have Google Chrome. The [poster template](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown) I use follows this process.

### pdf_document

If you're familiar with $\LaTeX$, you may be inclined to output directly to a PDF, since you can include inline $\LaTeX$ code in your documents (more on this in Chapter \@ref(format)). The [CV](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) and [manuscript](https://github.com/rosannav/thesis_in_rmarkdown/tree/master/example_thesis) templates that I use rely on the fine-grained typsetting capabilities of $\LaTeX$. To create a PDF, you need to have $\LaTeX$ installed locally. If you don't already, you can install the lightweight [`tinytex`](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) distribution through the R console.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
```

### word_document

You can also output to Microsoft Word and Powerpoint. I often work with colleagues who prefer to edit in Word, so sometimes I need to do this. I prefer not to if I can help it though, because you lose several important functions. For example, chunk options for aligning and setting the size of graphs and other images don't work, and `kable` tables tend not to appear correctly.

## Rendering options

### Knit

You can specify a particular output type in the YAML header with the **output** option. Then, you can press the **Knit** button or CTRL/command + shift + K to create or "knit" the document. 

Be sure to pay attention to indentation and colon placement in your YAML header, especially as you start to specify options for particular output types. As a rule of thumb, if you have anything more than **output: output_format**, you need to indent every new line, and have a colon at the end of the previous line. See Section \@ref(usedef) for an example of this.

### rmarkdown::render

Instead of knitting, you can also render files in console with `rmarkdown::render(file, output_format)`. This is essentially what **Knit** is doing. This approach allows you to create multiple output types quickly and easily. In my experience, I'm usually customizing my output very specifically for one output type by adding inline CSS or $\LaTeX$ code, so I really only use the `render()` function when I'm making [parameterized reports](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html%23parameter_types%2F).

## Rendering process

When you **Knit** or `render` your document, there's a particular sequence of events that happens under the hood. Your R Markdown document is piped through to pandoc by the `knitr` package, which runs your code chunks and knits them together with the plain text you've included. Pandoc ultimately handles the conversion to a particular output format. Understanding this process can help you troubleshoot when you run into issues. You can find more on troubleshooting in Chapter \@ref(trouble).
