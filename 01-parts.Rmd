# Parts of a document {#intro}

1. YAML header
2. Markdown
3. Code chunks

## YAML header

The first part of your document is called the YAML header. Here is where you set the global options for the output and formatting. In the example below, I show the YAML header for a set of `revealjs` slides (see Chapter \@ref(template) for more on creating slides with this and other packages). I've included basic information, like the title and date, in addition to template-specific parameters, like whether there should be slide numbers or not. Section \@ref(yamlref) has more information on setting YAML formatting parameters.

```{r parts_example_yaml, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/example_yaml.png")
```

## Markdown

The plain text-formatting syntax of R Markdown allows for conversion to multiple document types. This [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) provides an overview of the plain text syntax. The image below also shows an example of the basic syntax. \# denotes a header, with \## denoting a subheader and so on, while numbers will function like you would expect a numbered list to behave in Word. However, the actual numbers don't matter; I could've put all 1's here, and R Markdown would've formatted them for me.

```{r parts_example_markdown, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/example_markdown.png")
```

## Code chunks

Code chunks are one of the core features of R Markdown. Code chunks are set apart by three backticks. In curly brackets, you must specify the coding language you want to use (here, it's R). You can add other arguments, like a name for the chunk (here, it's "setup"), or other chunk options (like "echo = FALSE" to prevent the code from appearing in the document). You can find a full list of chunk options [here](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.148221175.1120335848.1588040224-1822605369.1586890951).

```{r parts_example_chunk}
# This is a chunk of R code that adds an image
knitr::include_graphics("images/example_chunk.png")
```
