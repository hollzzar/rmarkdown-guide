# The problem

- R Markdown is a highly useful platform for combining data processing/analysis and presentation
- There's a steep learning curve for really getting comfortable with R Markdown beyond the basics
- Graduate students are short on time

# The approach

How can I make R Markdown approachable and efficient to use for graduate students like me?

# The solution

- Started with tutorial for Cognitive Area Brownbag meeting
- Learned how to use `bookdown` to create a quick guide
- Created an [online guide hosted on GitHub](https://hollzzar.github.io/rmarkdown-guide/)

## Welcome

What is R Markdown and why should you use it?

## Parts of an R Markdown document

1. YAML header
2. Markdown
3. Code chunks

## Outputs

What can I make with R Markdown, and how?

## Templates

1. Built-in templates
2. Templates from R packages
3. User-defined templates

## Formatting

The real benefit of this guide and reason why I wanted to make it... because customization is hard (and I've spent countless hours trying to find this information for myself)

## Trouble-shooting

Because we've all been there.

## Tips

How to succeed with R Markdown, as well as with R in general:

- Treat your data as read-only
- Comment code early and often
- Keep code chunks small
- Label chunks for diagnosing issues
- Nest all files under one directory (if possible)
